        Hey hey! I'm LabRicecat, or more, a text written by LabRicecat. (just as cool, right??)
        <br> <br>
        If you don't know me yet, 1. <important>how did you get here?</important> and 2. welcome!
        <br>
        I'm a hobby programmer, happy air breather and certified neko! meow~
        <br>
        I go by any pronouns, as long as I get you mean me, i'm fine with it!
        <br><br>
        My biggest interest lies in text parsing, so putting some dumb text into a smort program! Sounds cool right? <important>It's pain</important>
        <br>
        Mainly, I use C++, as it's the first language I learned, but along my journey, some other interesting ones joined my collection.
        But that's <important>booooooooooooring</important> let's get to the fun stuff right?
        <br>
        <br>
        Fun part... there is not much to tell about me lol. <br>
        I don't know why you are here in the first place, just look at my cool projects or read my blog or something.
        <br><br>
        If you wonder how you can contact me, just use either the service you already know me from, or write 
        an email to <inline-code>labricecat@duck.com</inline-code> (but don't count on me reading them lol)
