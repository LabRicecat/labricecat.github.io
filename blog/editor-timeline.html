        An overview
    </header>

    <paragraph>
        I collected some interesting information about several editors that got created over the years,
        reaching back to the 1960s, and I just feel like sharing them at the moment. <br>
        (Oh and it might be helpful for reference later on)

        TECO (Text Editor and Corrector)
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        Not to confuse with "TECO Energy", a company founded around 20 years later, TECO is one of the earliest text editors, 
        invented 1962, for no notable modern operating system, namingly OS/8, ITS, TOPS and other. <br>
        It got its original name (Tape Editor and Corrector) from its creator Daniel Murphy, because of punch cards. <br>
        Notably, it's not only an editor, but also a working turing complete programming language.
    </paragraph>

    <header>
        QED (Quick Editor)
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        A nieche, but later on important text editor developed in 1966. It widespread and was later on used by
        bell labs, on their GE-600 systems. Notable names like Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernigan and others wrote later on <br>
        programs such as sed and ed, which to no big suprise where inspired by QED.
    </paragraph>

    <header>
        ed
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        One of the first unix utilities developed in 1969 for Unix like systems. 
        Still a line editor, but as Dennis Ritchie produced the definitive ed in 1973, it added new importants features, like regular expressions to QED, and hence
        inspired later on grep and ex.
    </paragraph>

    <header>
        EMacs
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        "EMacs" stands for "Editor Macros" and was first introduced in 1976 as a macro collection for TECO in the MIT AI Lab. <br>
        Later on called "E" and turned into a "What You See Is What You Get" editor and finally completely rewritten in C by Ritchard Stallman during 1984 and branded as GNU Emacs, which also added it's own domain specific programming language called Emacs Lisp. 
    </paragraph>

    <header>
        em
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        A more unknown editor, created by George Coulouris as he thought ed's user interface were only usable by immortals, so he made the "Editor for Mortals" in 1976,
        which therefore inspired the program ex.
    </paragraph>

    <header>
        ex
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        Short for "ed extended", it was developed by Bill Joy in 1976 and was an improved version of the ed editor, as many considered it missing important features.
        Just as ed, it was later on standardized in the POSIX standard.
        It also supported an LISP editor mode and the ability to recover files. 
    </paragraph>

    <header>
        vi
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        "Visual Mode" was, and still is, the first visual mode for the ex editor, moving away from the command line interfaces and moving on to visual editing and instantaneous feedback.
         Originally it was developed as an exptension for ex by Bill Joy, but later on got seperated into two programs, though to this day vi supports an special ex-mode enabling the known ex interface.
    </paragraph>

    <header>
        vim
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        Released in 1991 as an complete rewrite and refactor of vi, "vi improved", added notably "vimscript" and made the whole program much more customizable.
        Written by Bram Moolenaar, it is still one of the most used editors for programmers and everyone remotely doing something with *nix operating systems.
    </paragraph>

    <header>
        nvim
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        "Neo Vim" (or "neo visual mode for editor extended improved") is a younger project released in 2014 as a fork of vim, adding the ability for lua scripting and asynchronous I/0, as well as another rewrite and modernizazion.

        Summary
    </header>
    <paragraph>
        Programmers really love acronyms and will not stop adding new letters to already existing ones,
        but this timeline was really interesting to research as well as funny. Reaching back to the 70s and coming back to the present was an 
        interesting journey. Not to forget, it's important history to be remembered, so I wrote this as reference for later.
